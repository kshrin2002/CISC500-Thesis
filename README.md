## Using Explainable AI and Post-Hoc Analysis for Oncogene Prediction and Identification using Gene Expression Data

### Overview
This project explores the use of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques and post-hoc analysis to improve oncogene prediction and identification based on gene expression data. By leveraging deep learning models and interpretability methods, this research aims to enhance transparency in cancer classification tasks.

### Objectives
- Develop a deep learning model for oncogene classification using gene expression datasets (TCGA, TARGET, GTEx).
- Apply post-hoc explainability methods such as SHAP and LIME to interpret model decisions.
- Compare feature selection strategies (mean, variance, covariance) to assess their impact on oncogene prediction.
- Evaluate model performance and interpretability to improve clinical relevance.

### Dataset
This project utilizes publicly available gene expression datasets:
- **TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas)**
- **TARGET (Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments)**
- **GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression)**

### Methodology
1. **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.
2. **Model Development**: Implementing deep neural networks (DNNs) for classification.
3. **Explainability Analysis**: Using SHAP, LIME, and other techniques to interpret model predictions.
4. **Validation**: Validating contributing genes to existing cancer pathway databases.
